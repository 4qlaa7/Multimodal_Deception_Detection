# Deception Detection Using Multimodal Data

This repository contains code for deception detection using multimodal data, specifically focusing on video-based features and physiological signals. The models employ various machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict deceptive behavior based on real-life trials.

This work is based on the research paper titled: ["Multimodal Deception Detection in Real-Life Trials"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06005).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific modality or combination of modalities for deception detection. The steps involved in each notebook include data loading, preprocessing, model building, and training. 

### Dataset

The dataset used for training the models is the **Real Life Trials 2016** dataset, which contains videos and physiological signals collected for deception detection tasks. This dataset is publicly available and is used for studying deception detection in controlled real-life scenarios.

## Libraries and Dependencies

The following libraries are used in this repository:

- **cv2**: For image and video processing tasks.
- **mediapipe**: For extracting facial landmarks and other body pose data.
- **numpy**: For numerical computing and array manipulation.
- **pandas**: For handling and analyzing data in tabular format.
- **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation, including metrics and splitting the dataset.
- **tensorflow**: For deep learning model building and training.
- **keras**: For LSTM-based deep learning models, including Bidirectional LSTMs.
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn**: For visualizing results and metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, precision, recall).
- **pickle**: For saving and loading model checkpoints and data.

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- mediapipe
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Project Overview

Each notebook in the repository follows a similar structure for analyzing different modalities of deception detection:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is read and preprocessed to extract relevant features for the deception detection task.
2. **Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed to be suitable for training machine learning models.
3. **Modeling**: Various models are explored, including traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning models like LSTMs and Bidirectional LSTMs.
4. **Training**: The models are trained on the preprocessed data, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess performance.

The notebooks cover different combinations of modalities

## Model Description

The core of the model is a **Bidirectional LSTM** architecture for sequential data processing. This is combined with a dense layer for classification. The models are trained on sequences of features extracted from video and physiological signals to predict whether a subject is being deceptive or truthful.

## Model Evaluation

We use several metrics to evaluate model performance:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A visualization of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4qlaa7/Multimodal_Deception_Detection.git
   cd Multimodal_Deception_Detection
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the desired notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Follow the steps in each notebook to load, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive approach to deception detection using multimodal data. By exploring various combinations of video and physiological data, we aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of deception detection models.
